# Task Tracking App

I guess this is just a simple task tracking app, that tracks tasks.

-   **Frontend** - React
-   **Backend** - SpringBoot/Java \[[link](https://github.com/yahyafati/task_tracker_api)\]
-   **Database** - MySQL

## Prerequisites

0. The frontend is nothing without the API, so get the backend first [link](https://github.com/yahyafati/task_tracker_api)
1. Node v16 or higher

## How to run?

0. Download and Run the API first from this [link](https://github.com/yahyafati/task_tracker_api)

1. Download it first

```
git clone https://github.com/yahyafati/task_tracker_react
cd task_tracker_react
npm i
```

2. **Start**

```
npm start
```

> I guess that's it

## Things to fix later on

> Okay, this is all for me now. You can go. This is to make sure I do it later, you don't have to see this.

> Hopefully, public humiliation is a good motivator

1. Responsiveness
2. Some glitches
3. Dialog doesn't look like it fits with that UI (What are those colors ðŸ˜­)
4. Do more
